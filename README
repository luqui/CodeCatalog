Repository for unnamed code catalog project.

To get started:

Install django, and the django packages south and djapian.  Debian packages 
python-django, python-django-south and python-django-djapian.  Don't know about
Mac.

Then

% cd catalog
% python manage.py syncdb
(creates a local sqlite database -- will ask you some questions)
% python manage.py migrate
(prepares database schema (we're doing this to make it easy to migrate schemas later))
% python manage.py runserver

Now the server will be running on port 8000.  So browse to:

http://localhost:8000/new/

And it will ask you for a new snippet.  Write a python function.  After you submit and
the description page comes up, click the little blue edit buttons to expand the description.

After you have some snippets,

% python manage.py index --rebuild

to build the search index, then search by browsing to:

http://localhost:8000/search/
