<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>We have some open source tools for interfacing with <tt>codecatalog.net</tt> currently
in development, which we think will be ready within the next couple of weeks.  You can see
the progress at <a href="http://codecatalog.googlecode.com">the Google Code repository</a>,
and even try to use them (but we don't promise it will be a nice experience).
