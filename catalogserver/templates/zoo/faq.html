<h2 id="q1">What is this place?</h2>
<p>CodeCatalog is a lot like a wiki for source code.  We aim to socially build
a database of high-quality, well-documented, instantly-usable code in a variety
of languages.</p>
<h2 id="q2">So it's like GitHub/SourceForge/Google Code?</h2>
<p>Not exactly.  CodeCatalog focuses on <i>small, reusable</i> snippets of
code.  So this isn't the place for your RPG game or complete
website&mdash;although many of the generally applicable functions and classes
you used to create it do belong here. For example: API integration, functions
for working with geometry, networking utilities, natural language processing
tools, ...</p>
<h2 id="q3">How do I use code from the site?</h2>
<p>Just copy and paste, or use our <a href="/tools/">tools</a>.  Copy and paste
and duplicate to your heart's content: we tag the snippets from the site so
that you can use our tools to scan your code for updates and bugfixes.  That
means (most of) the usual evils of copying and pasting are mitigated.</p>
<h2 id="q4">What are these <tt>// CodeCatalog Snippet</tt> comments?</h2>
<p>Those are the tags that our tools use to cross-reference the code in your
codebase with the code on the site.  The URL brings you to the page with the
documentation for that snippet.  It's okay to change the code between the tags;
if you run the updater tool, it will ask you if you want to upload your changes
or keep them for yourself.</p>
<h2 id="q5">How do I put new code on the site?</h2>
<p>First, you need to be <a href="/openid/login/?next=/faq/">logged in</a> to
change anything on the site except for filing bugs.  Once you are logged in,
search for it.  If you find a <i>spec</i> (a collection of snippets that do the
same thing, possibly in multiple languages) that describes your code, click
<b>Add Snippet</b> at the bottom of the page.  Otherwise, there is a place to
add a new snippet at the bottom of the search results page.</p>
<p>If your code depends on any libraries or other snippets, there is a place at
the bottom of new snippet box to add them.  See <a href="/90/">this</a> for an
example of how we do external library dependencies.  We want code to be
<i>instantly usable</i>, so fill out all the dependencies if you are able,
so that if someone clicks <b>Expand Dependencies</b>, they can drop the code
anywhere and it will just work.</p>
<h2 id="q9">My favorite language isn't in the list of languages.  Will you support it?</h2>
<p>The bare minimum we need to support a language is to know its single
line comment character (e.g. <tt>//</tt> in C++).  So add your language
to the snippets on the <a href="/29/">line comment map</a> spec in Python
and Javascript and we will support it within a day (we are working on a
solution that will allow us to support it in 5 minutes).  You can also
add its <a href="/68/">file extension</a> to support it in our
<a href="/tools/">command line tool</a>.  As we add more types of support,
we'll list the specs that "understand" language features here.</p>
<h2 id="q6">I have some code from my project.  Should I put on the site?</h2>
<p>We want the code on the site to be <i>generally reusable</i>, so there
should be a chance that somebody else could benefit from your code.  A good
rule of thumb is that if you need to mention the name of your project in order
to describe what the function does, it <i>shouldn't</i> go on the site.</p>
<h2 id="q7">Why would I want to risk letting other people change my code?</h2>
<p>It's the same philosophy as a wiki.  Some people will change it for the
worse, but the general good and skill of the community will tend to improve the
code over time.  You get the benefit of many skilled eyes looking over your
code for bugs and corner cases.  Besides, you always keep a local copy of any
code you are using and you get a chance to review any changes before they enter
your codebase.  If you don't like them, you can fix it on the site for everyone
to see, or just remove the tags to fork the code into your own local version
independent of the site.</p>
<h2 id="q8">Just small reusable snippets? Doesn't that mean that nothing complex can ever be on the site?</h2>
<p>No, we hope that complex code does evolve on the site.  Snippets can depend
on other snippets and on external libraries in each language, so complex code
should be built as a <i>composition</i> of simpler, generally-applicable ideas,
instead of as a big mass of coupled logic.</p>
<h2 id="q10">What are the licensing terms of code on the site?</h2>
<p>Code on the site is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 license</a>,
a <i>public domain</i> license.  Basically you can use the code however you want,
its attachment to its author is completely forfeitted.  There is no warranty
on the content of the site, basically don't sue anybody.  By uploading code to
the site you agree that you have the legal authority to licence the code under
